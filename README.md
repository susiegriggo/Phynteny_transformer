### Build Transformer model for predicting the missing function of genomes in phage genomes 


NEXT: 
- Write code for generating the esm embeddings inside the model 
- Modify loss function 
- Make comparisons with model where the predictions get shuffled to show if order improves prediction capability 
- add testing data 
- Need to consider how the results of each kfold model are combined. Do something similar to the Phynteny score or the PHANNs score
