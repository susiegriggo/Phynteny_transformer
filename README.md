### Build Transformer model for predicting the missing function of genomes in phage genomes 


NEXT: 
- Address GPU memory issues for large training set. Clear gpu cache, ask chatgpt for other ideas 
- Add some dropout to the model to help prevent overfitting 
- Save loss and validation loss to a csv file 
- Make comparisons with model where the predictions get shuffled to show if order improves prediction capability 
- add testing data 
- Need to consider how the results of each kfold model are combined. Do something similar to the Phynteny score or the PHANNs score
